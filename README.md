# Document Version Manager

A modern, responsive web application for **Software Configuration Management (SCM)**, built to allow users to upload documents, maintain multi-version baselines, compare versions with visual line-by-line diffs, restore previous baselines non-destructively, download document representations, and inspect repository audit logs.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed for a college **Software Configuration Management** curriculum demonstration. It models the core lifecycle and tenets of SCM:
1. **Configuration Identification**: Unique document IDs, baseline tagging (`v1.0`, `v2.0`, `v3.0`), timestamps, and owner attribution.
2. **Configuration Control**: Structured upload workflows, version bump tracking, and mandatory commit change descriptions.
3. **Configuration Status Accounting**: Continuous activity logging of user actions (Upload, Restore, Compare, Archive, Download) with real-time timestamps.
4. **Configuration Verification & Audit**: Side-by-side split visual diff inspection to verify additions, deletions, and modifications between baselines prior to rollback.

The user interface follows a modern SaaS dashboard aesthetic (clean white cards, light slate backgrounds, navy typography, primary blue accents, and responsive layout) while remaining 100% static, lightweight, and framework-free for quick local execution in VS Code and zero-build deployment on Netlify.

## ✨ Key Features

- **SaaS Landing Page (`index.html`)**: Product hero, SCM feature cards, architecture overview, and quick links.
- **Secure Authentication UI (`login.html` & `otp.html`)**:
  - Validates 10-digit Indian mobile numbers (`+91`).
  - 6-digit OTP verification with automatic input tabbing, paste handling, and 30-second resend timer.
  - **Demo Mode OTP:** `123456`.
- **Main SaaS Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)**:
  - 4 Summary metric cards: Total Documents, Total Versions, Storage Used, Recent Updates.
  - Interactive documents table with category filters (All, PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPT/Images, Archived).
  - Dynamic instant search by document name, owner, type, or version.
  - Real-time audit activity feed.
- **Drag & Drop Upload (`upload.html`)**:
  - Drag-and-drop zone supporting PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, and Images.
  - File metadata extraction (name, size, type).
  - Support for creating a new document or bumping a new version to an existing document.
  - Simulated multi-step progress bar (integrity analysis, checksum generation, metadata write).
- **Version History Timeline (`versions.html`)**:
  - Interactive vertical timeline showing every baseline release.
  - Actions per version: Preview Content, Download representation, Compare, and Restore.
  - Highlights active baseline with distinct badges.
- **Visual Diff Engine (`compare.html`)**:
  - Side-by-side comparison between Version A and Version B.
  - Visual delta highlighting:
    - **Green (+)**: Added lines.

    - **Amber (~)**: Modified lines.
  - Summary metrics banner: "X changes detected (Added, Removed, Modified)".
  - Quick single-click restore options from either baseline.
- **Safe Non-Destructive Restore**:
  - Restoring a previous version changes the active baseline pointer while keeping all subsequent versions and audit trails preserved.
- **Document Download Engine**:
  - Generates downloadable text representations using HTML5 Blobs with SHA integrity labels.
- **Notifications Center (`notifications.html`)**:
  - Read/unread states, filter tabs, and "Mark all as read" capability.
- **Profile Page (`profile.html`)**:
  - Student profile for **Dinesh Kumar R**, course credentials, mobile mask, and edit modals.
- **Admin Dashboard (`admin.html`)**:
  - System-wide metric cards (Users, Documents, Versions, Storage).
